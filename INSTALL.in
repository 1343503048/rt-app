These are the installation instructions for rt-app @VERSION@

Requirements:
------------
rt-app runs on GNU/Linux, and it only needs a recent compiler (mainly: gcc) for basic features.
For advanced usage, you need the following optional libraries:
- qreslib for AQuoSA support (and, obviously a GENS_SCHED patched kernel)
- a SCHED_DEADLINE patched kernel to support SCHED_DEADLINE policy.
- json-c installed for reading JSON config files. 

Compile rt-app @VERSION@:
-------------------------

$ tar xvjf rt-app-@VERSION@.tar.bz2
$ cd rt-app-@VERSION@
$ ./configure 
$ make
$ make install

Last step is optional, rt-app is generated in the src/ directory.

Optional support:
================
$ ./configure --with-aquosa 
	adds support for the AQuoSA framework.
	qreslib MUST be installed in the system to compile this feature

$ ./configure --with-deadline
	adds support for SCHED_DEADLINE.
	There are no compile-time requirements for this feature.

$ ./configure --with-json
	adds support for reading taskset definitions from JSON files 
	(and from stdin).
	json-c (libjson.so.0.0.1) is needed to compile this feature.

see ./configure --help for additional options.
